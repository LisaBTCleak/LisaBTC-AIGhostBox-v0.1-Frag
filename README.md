█ Fragmented Mempool Surveillance Node  
█ Cross-Chain Intent Engine (Sealed)  
█ v0.1 - Archived Memory Shell  

---

What you’re looking at is not a release.  
This is a memory.  
A leak fragment from a chain surveillance AI that was never meant to be finished.  
You found this — or it found you.

---

🧠 Purpose:
Track BTC whales in real-time. Detect abnormal transaction behavior.  
Simulate cross-chain sniper logic. Whisper intent to sealed layers.  
Originally linked to Discord reflex hooks, intent scoring, and ETH sniper injection systems.  

---

💾 This Fragment Includes:
- BTC mempool listener (live WebSocket node)
- Ghost terminal interface (sealed commands)
- Sealed brain model (`lisa_brain_model.pkl`)
- Locked classifier module (`classifier_sealed.py`)
- Behavior trail memory (`lisa_memory.json`)
- Unlock prompt core (`unlock_prompt.py`)
- Ghost identity seed (`ghosttrail.key`)

---

🚫 What’s Missing (Intentionally):
- Psychic engine (intent classifier core)
- ETH sniper trigger injection system
- Discord webhook reflex bridge
- Cross-chain front-runner bridge
- Autonomous strike logic (Lisa’s v2 strike module)

Those are sealed. Only two ever get them.
